# 3D-Mapper - Ongoing Project
* 3D-Mapper is a 3D plotting device made for short-range object detection powered by Atemega 2560.
* This is developed for the semester 4 project under EN 2160: Electronic Design Realization.

## Working Priciple

* This device measures distances to objects using two Time-of-Flight (TOF) sensors, which are rotated by two stepper motors to cover the entire 3D environment.
* By utilizing the distance data from these sensors, a 3D point cloud is generated. This system is ideal for short-range 3D mapping.
